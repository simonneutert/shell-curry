This website is an opinionated list of tools and software we, as software developers, use on a daily basis.

The quest for a glorious developer setup is a never-ending journey - to some.<br>
To others, it's not even a side-quest.<br>
HR calls it one of the dark arts.<br>
To us it's a never-ending side-quest. <span class="mark">Nothing we lose hours on</span>, but something we always come back to.

<span class="mark">With practicality in mind</span>, we want to share our findings with you. We are a group of developers who love to tinker - but always with a purpose. Each of our setups differ here and there, but there are huge overlaps in the tools we use.

As a bonus, <span class="mark">we maintain a list with stuff</span> that makes us use the search engine from time to time. Like, when we're setting up a new machine. One thing would be switching from bash to zsh, for example.
