> But, there's [alebcay/awesome-shell](https://github.com/alebcay/awesome-shell) on GitHub?!

We know, and it's awesome‚Äîbut it is a very, very long list! \
Here, you'll find our curated list of tools, so you can be sure they work well and are put to use regularly.

Having the best developer setup is a never-ending crusade for some.<br>
To others, it's not even a side quest.<br>
In HR, they label it as one of the dark arts.<br>
<span class="mark">To us, it's nothing we lose hours on</span>, but something we always come back to.

We want to share our findings with you, <span class="mark">with practicality in mind</span>. We are a group of developers who love to tinker‚Äîalways with a purpose. Each of our setups differs here and there, but there are huge overlaps in the tools we use.

When you follow and finish an example setup, the `tab` key will have superpowers (hit it, baby!), \
`ctrl+r` will melt your heart (it already will if you didn't know), \
and colors will please your eyes.

Oh and icons in your terminal? Yes, please!

As a bonus, <span class="mark">we maintain a list of stuff</span> that makes us use the search engine from time to time. Like when we're setting up a new machine. One example would be switching from bash to zsh.
