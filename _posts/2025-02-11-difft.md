Sometimes, one forgets ... when updating brew this evening.

Difftastic popped up. Well, that rang a bell.

Quick lookup. Yes, it was already installed, but never configured properly. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I quickly added this to my global `.gitconfig`:

```toml
[alias]
    # Difftastic aliases, so `git dlog` is `git log` with difftastic and so on.
    dlog = -c diff.external=difft log --ext-diff
    dshow = -c diff.external=difft show --ext-diff
    ddiff = -c diff.external=difft diff
```

https://github.com/wilfred/difftastic is awesome! ü§©
