Does the following image make you feel sad?

No wonder! We all know someone whose terminal is their sanctuary of joy and
productivity.

### Not Sure Where to Start?

We've got your back! Soon, we'll be sharing bite-sized guides on how to spice up
your terminal.

### No Need to Invest a Lot of Time!

For some developers, the quest for the perfect setup is a never-ending journey.
For others, it barely registers on their radar.

For us? It's a delightful side quest that never quite ends.

**But for you, it could be just a 30-minute adventure.**

We're keeping things practical as we share our discoveries with you. While we're
developers who love to tinker, we always do it with purpose. Though each of our
setups is unique, we've found ourselves gravitating toward many of the same
tools.

We're just a bunch of developers who love fine-tuning our environments, and
we're excited to share what we've learned with you! ðŸ¤—
