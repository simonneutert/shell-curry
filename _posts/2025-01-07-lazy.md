When it comes to developers, laziness isn’t a flaw—it’s a superpower. Think about it: lazy evaluation of code, writing less code to reduce complexity (when done right), and automating everything in sight. If there’s a task we do more than once, the instinct to script it away is practically second nature.  

And yes, let’s not forget: **automate, automate, automate.**

But wait... this doesn’t sound lazy anymore, does it? Okay, back to the topic.

## The "Lazy" Way to Work Smarter

Managing Git and Docker without leaving the terminal? That’s not just efficient—it’s what I like to call *context-switching laziness*. Why waste precious brainpower jumping between windows when you can stay in your flow?

Here are two amazing tools that embody the true spirit of developer laziness (and productivity):  

- **[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit):** A simple terminal UI for Git commands.  
- **[Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker):** A terminal UI for managing Docker.  

Give them a try—you might just find that "being lazy" is the smartest move you’ve made today.  

Are you a visual learner? \
