ASDF regularly timed out on my machine. I was used to this.

But when I cam across this
[blog post](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/comparison-to-asdf.html#asdf-in-go-0-16)
where they tackled mise's concept of security - was when I knew, I had to try.

And, well, as harsh as it may sound, but:

> ASDF, farewell old friend, you were the successor of [rvm](https://rvm.io) and
> all good things come to an end.

`mise` will take over from now on my machines.
