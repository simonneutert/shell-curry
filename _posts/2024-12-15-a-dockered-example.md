title:  "A Dockered Example for a spiced zsh on Debian 12"

It's always nice to have a `Dockerfile` to start from. Here is an example of a `Dockerfile` that brings some of the tools and plugins mentioned in the [previous post](/posts/2024/12/14/debian12-simon.html).

Here's a link to the repository. You'll find the Documenation there, too ✌️
